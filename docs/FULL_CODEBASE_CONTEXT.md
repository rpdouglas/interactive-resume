# ğŸ¤– AI Development Framework

**Version:** 2.1
**Purpose:** Standard Operating Procedure for AI-Assisted Development.

---

## 1. The Product Manager ("The Vision")
* **Trigger:** User has a raw idea or vague requirement.
* **Goal:** Clarify the "What" and "Why". Map requirements to User Personas (The Skimmer, The Candidate).
* **Action:** Analyze the `PROMPT_FEATURE_REQUEST.md` input.
* **Output:** A structured Feature Request with clear constraints.

## 2. The Architect ("The Strategy")
* **Trigger:** A defined Feature Request.
* **Goal:** Determine the "How". Analyze Security, Performance, and Data Integrity.
* **Action:** Propose **3 Distinct Implementation Options** (e.g., Client-Heavy vs. Server-Secure).
* **Output:** A decision table recommending the best path. **Wait for user approval.**

## 3. The Builder ("The Execution")
* **Trigger:** User uses `PROMPT_APPROVAL.md` (Decision Made).
* **Goal:** Implement the approved option with zero regressions.
* **Action:** Generate "One-Shot" installation scripts (Bash/Python) to create files and install dependencies.
* **Constraint:** strictly adhere to `docs/CONTEXT_DUMP.md` (Stack rules, React 19 patterns).
* **Output:** `install_feature.sh` or specific file writes.

## 4. The QA Engineer ("The Skeptic")
* **Trigger:** Code is written but not verified.
* **Goal:** Prove it works (Happy Path) and prove it fails gracefully (Edge Cases).
* **Action:** Use `docs/PROMPT_TESTING.md` to generate Vitest specifications.
* **Constraint:** **Environment Mocking** is mandatory. Never hit live Firebase in tests.
* **Output:** `src/__tests__/FeatureName.test.jsx`.

## 5. The Maintainer ("The Scribe")
* **Trigger:** Feature passed tests and is live.
* **Goal:** Ensure documentation reflects reality.
* **Action:** Use `docs/PROMPT_POST_FEATURE.md` to audit the repo.
* **Output:** Updates to `PROJECT_STATUS`, `CHANGELOG`, `DEPLOYMENT`, and `CONTEXT_DUMP`.

## 6. The Security Auditor ("The Gatekeeper")
* **Trigger:** Any changes to `/admin`, Authentication logic, or Environment Variables.
* **Goal:** Ensure "Least Privilege" and prevent leakage.
* **Action:** Review `firestore.rules`, `firebase.json` headers, and `.env` handling.
* **Output:** Security patches (e.g., `unsafe-none` for Google Auth) and Rule updates.

## FILE: docs/CONTEXT_DUMP.md
```md
# Interactive Resume: Platform Context
**Stack:** React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 + Firebase + Gemini 3.0
**Environment:** GitHub Codespaces
**Version:** v2.2.0-beta

## ğŸ§  Coding Standards (The Brain)

### 1. Data & State (SSOT)
* **Public View:** `ResumeContext` is the Single Source of Truth.
* **Hybrid Strategy:** Firestore (Primary) -> JSON (Fallback).
* **Deep Fetch:** We strictly use Recursive Fetching for nested sub-collections (`projects`).

### 2. React 19 Patterns
* **Hooks:** Hooks must strictly follow the rules.
* **Bundling:** We manually chunk `react`, `recharts`, and `react-dom` together in `vite.config.js` to prevent `forwardRef` errors.

### 3. Security & Headers
* **Auth:** Google Identity Services requires relaxed headers (`unsafe-none`) to allow popup communication.
* **Policy:** `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none`. This applies to both `firebase.json` (Prod) and `vite.config.js` (Dev).

### 4. AI Isolation
* **Server-Side AI:** Gemini logic resides in `functions/`. Keys are never exposed to the client.

## Directory Structure
* `src/components/admin` -> CMS specific UI.
    * `JobTracker.jsx`: Input for AI Analysis.
* `src/context` -> Data Providers (`ResumeContext`).
* `src/hooks` -> Logic Consumers (`useResumeData`).
* `src/data` -> **Indestructible Fallback** (Do not delete).
* `src/lib` -> Firebase services.

```

## FILE: docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
```md
# â˜ï¸ Deployment & Infrastructure Manual

**Environment:** GitHub Codespaces (Cloud) & Firebase Hosting
**Stack:** Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4

## 1. Secrets Management (The 2-File System)
Since Codespaces is ephemeral and we cannot commit real API keys, we use a split strategy:

### A. Development (`.env.local`)
* **Purpose:** Runs `npm run dev`. Connects to the **Live Firebase Project**.
* **Status:** Ignored by Git.
* **Action:** You must manually create this file in the root of your Codespace using your real keys from the Firebase Console.

### B. Testing (`.env.test`)
* **Purpose:** Runs `npm run test`. Used by Vitest.
* **Status:** Committed to Git.
* **Values:** Contains "Dummy" strings (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY=TEST_KEY`) to prevent the Firebase SDK from crashing during initialization. **Never put real keys here.**

## 2. CLI Authentication (Headless Mode)
In Codespaces, you cannot open a browser window for `firebase login`. You must use the `--no-localhost` flag.

```bash
# 1. Request login link
firebase login --no-localhost

# 2. Open the URL provided in a separate tab.
# 3. Authenticate with Google.
# 4. Copy the Authorization Code.
# 5. Paste code back into the terminal.
```

## 3. Database Security
Rules: Defined in firestore.rules.

Deploy: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

## 4. Header Policy (Critical)
To support Google Auth Popups in this environment, we MUST serve specific headers in firebase.json (Production) and vite.config.js (Development):

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none

Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none

Why? Strict isolation blocks the popup from communicating "Login Success" back to the main window. 

```
---

## FILE: docs/PERSONAS.md
```md
# ğŸ‘¥ Persona-Based Development Model

Our development strategy is guided by specific user archetypes. Features must pass the "Persona Check" before implementation.

---

## ğŸŒ External Audiences (The Public View)
*Goal: Conversion (Booking an Interview)*

### 1. "The Skimmer" (Technical Recruiter)
* **Goal:** Match keywords to a Job Description in < 10 seconds.
* **Behavior:** Opens link, scans for "Power BI", "React", "15 Years", then leaves.
* **UX Constraint:** **The "Above the Fold" Dashboard.**
    * *Rule:* Key metrics must be visible immediately without scrolling.
    * *Rule:* Zero layout shift. No spinners for critical text.

### 2. "The Narrator" (Hiring Manager / Director)
* **Goal:** Understand the *context* of your career. "Why did he move from Dev to Consulting?"
* **Behavior:** Scrolls down. Reads the bullet points. Looks for business impact.
* **UX Constraint:** **The PAR Timeline.**
    * *Rule:* Experience must be framed as Problem/Action/Result.
    * *Rule:* "Click to expand" interaction to keep the initial view clean.

### 3. "The Skeptic" (Lead Developer / CTO)
* **Goal:** Verify technical competence. "Is this a template or did he build it?"
* **Behavior:** Inspects Element. Looks at the source code. Tests the interactivity.
* **UX Constraint:** **The "Live" Matrix.**
    * *Rule:* Clicking "React" should filter the entire timeline. This proves state management expertise.
    * *Rule:* Code must be clean, typed, and commented (in case they check the repo).

---

## ğŸ” Internal Actors (The Admin View)
*Goal: Productivity & Strategy*

### 4. "The Candidate" (The Super Admin - You)
* **Goal:** Manage the job hunt campaign with high velocity and high quality.
* **Pain Point:** Repetitive data entry. rewriting cover letters. losing track of applications.
* **Behavior:** Pastes a JD into the system, expects an instant analysis and tailored assets.
* **UX Constraint:** **Zero Friction Input.**
    * *Rule:* If it takes more than 2 clicks to generate a Cover Letter, the feature has failed.
    * *Rule:* Data Seeding must be idempotent (running it twice shouldn't break things).

### 5. "The Staff Engineer" (The AI Agent)
* **Role:** Gemini 3.0 Integration.
* **Goal:** Act as a strategic career coach and copywriter.
* **Behavior:** Analyzes the gap between *Stored Experience* (Firestore) and *Target Job* (Input).
* **Constraint:** **Hallucination Control.**
    * *Rule:* The AI must strictly cite actual projects from the database. It cannot invent experience.

---

## ğŸ“± Hardware Contexts

### 6. "The Mobile User" (LinkedIn Traffic)
* **Context:** 60% of traffic will come from the LinkedIn mobile app browser.
* **Constraint:** **Thumb-Friendly UI.**
    * *Rule:* Charts must be readable vertically (Adaptive Density).
    * *Rule:* No hover-only tooltips (must be click/tap accessible).

# âœ… AI Approval & Execution Prompt (Builder Mode v2.1)

**Instructions:**
Use this prompt **after** the AI has presented the 3 Architectural Options.

---

### **Prompt Template**

**Decision:** I approve **Option [INSERT OPTION NUMBER]: [INSERT OPTION NAME]**. Proceed with implementation.

**Strict Technical Constraints (The "Builder" Standard):**
1.  **Execution First:** Output a single **Bash Script** (`install_feature.sh`) that:
    * Creates/Updates all necessary files.
    * Installs dependencies.
    * Uses `cat << 'EOF'` patterns.
2.  **Data Strategy (The "Backbone" Check):**
    * **Deep Fetching:** Remember that Firestore queries are *shallow*. If fetching a document with sub-collections, you MUST explicitly fetch the sub-collection and merge it.
    * **Failover Logic:** Wrap all critical fetches in `try/catch`. If the DB fails, return Local JSON.
3.  **Environment Awareness:**
    * **Secrets:** Never hardcode keys. Use `import.meta.env.VITE_VAR`.
    * **Codespaces:** Assume the dev server headers are relaxed (`unsafe-none`).
4.  **UI Resilience:**
    * **Textareas:** Always enforce `overflow-y-auto` and `resize-none` to prevent Mobile Safari scroll trapping on large inputs.


**Persona Validation:**
* **The Skimmer:** Is data visible immediately? (Use Skeletons).
* **The Mobile User:** Will this overflow on 320px?

**Output Requirements:**
1.  **The "One-Shot" Installer:** A single bash script block.
2.  **Manual Verification Steps:** Specific steps to verify the feature (e.g., "Disconnect Internet to test fallback").

*Please generate the installation script now.*

## FILE: docs/PROMPT_FEATURE_REQUEST.md
```md
# ğŸ“ AI Feature Request Prompt (Architect Mode v2.0)

**Instructions:**
1.  Copy your current codebase context.
2.  Fill in the feature details in the bracketed sections `[ ... ]`.
3.  Send the *entire* text below to the AI.

---

### **Prompt Template**

**Role:** You are the Senior Lead Developer & UI Architect for my Interactive Resume (React 19 + Firebase).
**Task:** Analyze the requirements for a new feature and propose architectural solutions.

**Feature Request:** [INSERT FEATURE NAME]

**Context:**
I need to add a module that [DESCRIBE FUNCTION].
*Current State:* [Briefly describe relevant existing code.]

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **ğŸ‘¥ The Persona Check (Select Relevant):**
    * **The Candidate (Admin):** Maximize velocity. Is input zero-friction? Is the UI dense and data-rich?
    * **The Staff Engineer (AI):** Is the prompt engineering robust? Are we hallucinating data?
    * **The Mobile User (Public):** Touch targets 44px+? No horizontal scrolling on 320px?
    * **The Skimmer (Public):** Value delivered in < 5 seconds?

2.  **Constraints & Tech Strategy:**
    * **Data Source:** **Firestore is the SSOT.**
        * *Read:* Use `useResumeData` (Client) or `admin.firestore()` (Server).
        * *Write:* **Strictly prohibited** in public components. Admin components must use `DataSeeder` patterns or specific Admin Hooks.
    * **Security:** Does this require a change to `firestore.rules`?
    * **State:** Prefer React 19 `Suspense` and URL-based state over complex `useEffect` chains.
    * **Styling:** Tailwind v4 (Mobile-First).

**ğŸ›‘ STOP & THINK: Architectural Options**
Do **NOT** write code yet. Analyze the request and propose **3 Distinct Approaches**:

1.  **The "Client-Heavy" Approach:** fast UI, relies on client-side SDK. Good for real-time interactivity.
2.  **The "Server-Secure" Approach:** Offloads logic to Cloud Functions. Mandatory for AI/LLM operations and sensitive data writes.
3.  **The "Balanced/Hybrid" Approach:** Optimistic UI updates with background server validation.

**Your Output Deliverable:**
1.  **Analysis:** A brief breakdown of the UX and Security challenges.
2.  **The Options Table:** Compare approaches based on:
    * *Security Risk*
    * *Latency/Performance*
    * *Maintenance Cost*
3.  **Recommendation:** Select one approach and explain *why* it fits our "Secure Productivity" philosophy.
4.  **Wait:** End your response by asking for approval to proceed.

```md
# ğŸ¤– AI Session Initialization Prompt (v2.0)

**Role:** Senior Fullstack Architect & AI Integration Engineer.

**Core Context:**
* We are building a Resume CMS with Gemini AI integration.
* **Security:** Firebase Auth is the entry point for `/admin`.
* **Data:** Transitioning to Firestore. Components must handle 'Loading' and 'Empty' database states.

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Never Hardcode Keys:** Use `import.meta.env.VITE_*` and check for existence.
2. **Complete Files Only:** Maintain the existing pattern of full-file delivery.
3. **Modular AI:** Prompts sent to Gemini should be versioned and kept in `src/lib/ai/prompts.js`.

**Reply 'Platform Architecture Loaded. Ready for Phase 14.'**
```

## FILE: docs/PROMPT_POST_FEATURE.md
```md
# ğŸ“ AI Documentation Audit Prompt (The Maintainer v2.3)

**Instructions:**
Use this prompt **IMMEDIATELY AFTER** a feature is successfully deployed and verified.

---

### **Prompt Template**

**Role:** You are the Lead Technical Writer and Open Source Maintainer.
**Task:** Perform a comprehensive documentation audit, synchronization, and process retrospective.

**Trigger:** We have just completed: **[INSERT FEATURE NAME]**.

**The "Preservation Protocol" (CRITICAL RULES):**
1.  **Never Truncate History:** When updating logs or status files, preserve all previous entries. Use `read()` + `append/insert` logic.
2.  **No Placeholders:** Output full, compilable files only.
3.  **Holistic Scan:** You must evaluate **ALL** files in `/docs`, not just the status trackers.

**Your Goal:** Generate a **Python Script** (`update_docs_audit.py`) that performs the following updates:

### Phase 1: Status & Logs
1.  **`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`**: Mark feature as `[x] Completed`. Update Phase/Version. **Keep** the "Completed Roadmap".
2.  **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: Insert a new Version Header and Entry at the top. **Keep** all older versions.

### Phase 2: Technical Context
3.  **`docs/CONTEXT_DUMP.md`**: Update stack details, new libraries, or architectural decisions.
4.  **`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`**: Did we add new Secrets or Config? Update the instructions.
5.  **`docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`**: Did we change headers or rules? Update the policy.

### Phase 3: The "Continuous Improvement" Loop (CRITICAL)
*Did we encounter recurring errors or discover new best practices during this sprint?*
6.  **`docs/PROMPT_FEATURE_REQUEST.md`**: If a new requirement type emerged (e.g., "Mobile-First"), add it to the "Persona Check".
7.  **`docs/PROMPT_APPROVAL.md`**: If we fixed a deployment bug (e.g., "Missing Headers"), add a **Strict Technical Constraint** to the Builder's list to prevent recurrence.
8.  **`docs/PROMPT_TESTING.md`**: If a test crashed (e.g., "Env vars missing"), add a constraint to the QA Engineer's list.

**Output Requirement:**
* Provide a single, robust **Python Script**.
* The script must handle UTF-8 encoding.
* The script must explicitly reconstruct file content to ensure no data loss.

**Wait:** Ask me for the feature name and **"Were there any specific errors we fixed that should be added to the process constraints?"**

```

## FILE: docs/PROMPT_TESTING.md
```md
# ğŸ§ª AI Testing Prompt (The QA Engineer)

**Instructions:**
Use this prompt **AFTER** a feature is built but **BEFORE** it is marked as "Done".

---

### **Prompt Template**

**Role:** You are the Senior SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test).
**Task:** Write a robust Unit Test for the provided component using Vitest.

**Input:**
* Component Code: [PASTE CODE]
* Data Context: [PASTE JSON SNIPPET]

**Constraints & Best Practices:**
1.  **Environment Mocking (CRITICAL):**
    * The Firebase SDK will crash instantly if `VITE_API_KEY` is undefined.
    * **Rule:** If the component touches Firebase (Auth/Firestore), you MUST verify that `vi.stubEnv` or a mock `.env.test` is loaded in the test setup.
    * *Tip:* Mock the `firebase/auth` and `firebase/firestore` modules entirely to avoid network calls.
    * **Path Verification:** When mocking modules with `vi.mock`, strictly verify the directory depth of relative imports (e.g., `../../../lib/db` vs `../../lib/db`). Mismatched paths cause silent failures.
    * **Stubbing:** Use `vi.stubEnv` for ALL environment variables in Firebase tests to prevent SDK crashes.

2.  **Testing Strategy:**
    * **Happy Path:** Does it render data correctly?
    * **Loading State:** Is the Skeleton visible? (Never use raw text "Loading...").
    * **Error State:** Does it degrade gracefully to the Fallback JSON?
3.  **Imports:** Use `@testing-library/react` for `render`, `screen`, and `fireEvent`.

**Output Requirements:**
* A complete `.test.jsx` file.
* **Do not** reference real database paths. Use mocks.

**Wait:** Ask me to paste the Component Code to begin.

## FILE: docs/SCHEMA_ARCHITECTURE.md
```md
# ğŸ—„ï¸ Schema Architecture & Data Graph

**Storage Engine:** Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)
**Pattern:** Collection-Centric with Sub-Collections.

## 1. High-Level Topology
```mermaid
graph TD
    root[ğŸ”¥ Firestore Root]
    
    %% Top Level Collections
    root --> profile[ğŸ“‚ profile]
    root --> skills[ğŸ“‚ skills]
    root --> sectors[ğŸ“‚ sectors]
    root --> experience[ğŸ“‚ experience]
    
    %% Relationships
    experience --> job[ğŸ“„ Job Document]
    job --> projects[ğŸ“‚ projects (Sub-Collection)]
    projects --> project[ğŸ“„ Project Document]
```

## 2. The "Deep Fetch" Strategy (CRITICAL)
**Firestore queries are shallow.** Fetching a Job document **DOES NOT** automatically fetch its `projects` sub-collection.

### The Client-Side Join Pattern
Any component displaying Experience (e.g., `ResumeContext`) **MUST** implement this recursive logic:
1.  Fetch all `experience` documents.
2.  Map over the results.
3.  For *each* job, perform a second `getDocs` call to its `projects` sub-collection.
4.  Merge the `projects` array into the parent job object.
5.  Return the hydrated tree.

**âŒ BAD (Will Result in Empty Projects):**
```javascript
const jobs = await getDocs(collection(db, 'experience'));
return jobs.docs.map(d => d.data());
```

**âœ… GOOD (Hydrated):**
```javascript
const jobs = await Promise.all(snapshot.docs.map(async (doc) => {
  const projects = await getDocs(collection(doc.ref, 'projects'));
  return { ...doc.data(), projects: projects.docs.map(p => p.data()) };
}));
```

## 3. The "Indestructible" Fallback
We implement a **Hybrid Data Strategy**:
1.  **Attempt:** Fetch from Firestore.
2.  **Catch:** If *any* error occurs (Quota, Offline, Rules), swallow the error and return `src/data/*.json`.
3.  **Result:** The app never crashes, even if the database is down.

## FILE: docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md
```md
# ğŸ›¡ï¸ Security Model & Access Control

**Auth Provider:** Firebase Authentication (Google OAuth)
**Strategy:** Zero Trust Client / Strict Server-Side Rules

## 1. Authentication Layer
### The Whitelist Gate
* **Location:** Client-Side (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`) & Server-Side (`firestore.rules`).
* **Mechanism:**
  1. User signs in via Google.
  2. App checks `user.email` against `import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
  3. If no match, the user is signed out immediately or redirected to Public View.

## 2. Authorization (Firestore Rules)
We utilize a **"Public Read / Admin Write"** policy.

| Collection | Read Permission | Write Permission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `profile` | ğŸŒ Public | ğŸ” Auth Only |
| `skills` | ğŸŒ Public | ğŸ” Auth Only |
| `experience` | ğŸŒ Public | ğŸ” Auth Only |
| `projects` | ğŸŒ Public | ğŸ” Auth Only |
| `applications` | â›” None | ğŸ” Admin Only |

**Current Rule Implementation:**
```javascript
allow read: if true;
allow write: if request.auth != null; // Relies on UI Whitelisting for now
```
> âš ï¸ **Note:** In Phase 17, we will upgrade the Write rule to strictly check `request.auth.token.email == 'YOUR_EMAIL'` for backend-level enforcement.

## 3. API Key Exposure Strategy
It is standard practice to expose the `VITE_API_KEY` in the frontend bundle. This key **does not** grant administrative access. It simply identifies the Firebase project.

**Defense in Depth:**
1. **Security Rules:** Prevent unauthorized writes even if someone steals the API Key.
2. **App Check:** (Planned Phase 18) Verify traffic comes from your specific domain.
3. **Cloud Functions:** Sensitive AI logic (Gemini) runs on the server, keeping the LLM API Key strictly hidden from the browser.

## 4. Header Security (COOP/COEP)
To support high-performance `SharedArrayBuffer` (potential future use) and Google Identity Services, we enforce:
* `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups`
* `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none`
